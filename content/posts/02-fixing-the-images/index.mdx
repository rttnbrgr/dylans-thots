And for my next trick... I will quickly solve a bug(?) I'm seeing.

## First Bug

i do this

```mdx
![Dylan](./dylan-face.png)
```

and i get this

<!-- ![Dylan](./dylan-face.png) --> // Screenshot of broken

// show sample of the problem with this

## First fix.

I'm apparently not the only one (link to gihub)
https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/15486

```css
.gatsby-resp-image-background-image {
  display: none !important;
}
```

## First Hack.

Things break. They need fixed. Sometimes you have time to fix them the best way there is to fix them.

Sometimes, you just have time to fix them.

Prolific me will do well to remember this lesson.
