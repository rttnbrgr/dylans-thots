## Make more things

Part of the plan this year is to make more things.

I want to make sometheing every month and share it with you. The person reading this.

I want to make stuff that scratches my own itch.

And I want to make sure I don't get too overwhelmed with minutia that doesn't ACTUALLY matter.

In the past, I get really excited about starting a new project and throw myself into it. And somewhere alont the way, maybe a couple hours. Maybe a couple weeks. You hit this wierd frustration point where the excitement for it has run out and its tough to see through the trees. There are many a project of mine buried in these forests. One thing I notice that a lot of those projects have in commong is getting mired in minutia. Wanting the thing to work _JUST-PERFECTLY-SO_. Not feeling comfortable with shipping the shitty first draft.

Part of it is an experience thing. And another part is just fear.

Fear of failure.

Fear of feeling average.

Fear that people will point and laugh.

## Plan of Attack

It's all well and good to want to make things. To have a new found resolve to kick off this next trip around the big star in the sky. But if I'm being honest, I've been here before. I've said stuff like this before. I want to give myself the best chance for success by outlining some of the steps to make this happen.

Here's the plan.

### Shorter Timelines

Each of these projects has to get done in a month. Which should help eliminate fatigue and bolster a sense of urgency.

### Reduced Scope

These aren't gigantic, unified field theorem projects. Their small-ish. Mini-projects. Byte-sized. Maybe one of them is the kick-off of another mini project. Or maybe it gives way to something bigger. But for now, for this portion of it, they stay small. They stay focused.

### Is there a quicker/uglier way to do that?

This is a shitty first draft. Things will be ugly. They will be non-optimal. The point is to complete what you set out to do. If this gives way to something larger, there will be time to revisit it. But for now, _JUST MAKE STUFF_.

## Lab 1.

The first project is just a big grid of album covers.

It's actually a sort of visual explorer for [The Needledrop's]() Top 50 Albums of 2019. I'm a big fan of melon and all the great shows.

But in all honesty, the root of this project is really around trying to get perfect squares to tile and scale in a responsive webpage. And to fill those squares with... _**ALBUM ARTOWRK!!!**_

This project has been bouncing around my head for years and half-started a dozen times. And its going live by the end of January.

It may not be FULL featured. It may(read: will) have some bugs. But this thing thats been living in my head forever will actually be live to share with people. Thats good thing.

EYE hope you will stick around to see it.
